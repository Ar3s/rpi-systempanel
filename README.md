*Soon will be released a demo version*

##Mobile Ready##
The Panel is mobile ready with support for iOS web apps bookmarked to Home Screen thanks to Bootstrap v3.

#Installation#
* Download all files to a directory available to webserver (Apache2 and Nginx are tested)
* Prepare an empty database on MySQL (it's the only DBMS supported for now)
* Access to the application (if install.php is not the first page, go to it) and set Database information and the first user access (it will be administrator)
* The panel is ready

*Settings panel is work in progress*

#IMPORTANT#
The panel requires Smarty v3 installed and in the PHP include path.<br />
*This feature will be dismissed on next milestone*
